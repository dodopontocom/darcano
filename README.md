It is an anagram for [Cardano](https://developers.cardano.org/)

### Cardano Stake Pool on Testnet
This repo will maintain scripts and miscellaneous regarding setting up a Stake Pool in Cardano TestNet.  
This will be implemented on cloud based infrastructure and automated as much as possible. Maybe multi-cloud but for now mostly in [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/products).
